        description: `Description: I once attempted to knit a scarf according to how I felt everyday, using different colors of yarn. This quickly becamea tangled mess, but the idea stuck! emOceans is a web application that allows you to take note of your mood every day using color and language. Each day (and each mood, each memory) forms a tiny drop in the vast and ever-shifting ocean that makes up every one of us. We hoped to make the observation and appreciation of these shifts and waves more accessible, helpful, and more beautiful.`,

Based on your choices throughout the game, you win and lose points in categories such as 'Health', 'Love', 'Growth', and 'Adventure'. You win, or life wins!`,
        contributions: `Contributions: I created all the interfaces with Tiled and Adobe Photoshop, and wrote Python for game play using Pygame.`

// bio2: `My discovery of web development was very much a happy accident. About a year after my decision to leave the classroom, I took a free 
//         JavaScript workshop on a whim. The syntax felt poetic to me, and because it is simply another means of making something out of nothing, 
//         I quickly became enamored by it. I see writing code as similar to writing a good poem: it should be clear, efficient, beatiful, and accessible. 
//         I'm still a student, but this is always my goal!`,
